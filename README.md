## Description

This is Forge Responsive Connected Database: A responsive React-based web application that showcases the use of Autodesk Forge Viewer and Forge web services, working in a connected environment with integrated data from multiple databases.

This sample uses Viewer v7, Babel v7, React v16, Redux v4, Bootstrap v3, jQuery v3, and Webpack v4, and serves as a reference sample for building Viewer apps with popular front end stacks like React/Bootstrap/Webpack etc. as well.

** If you are only interested in the extensions/plugins alone or would like to run this sample w/o MongoDB, see [library-javascript-viewer-extensions](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/library-javascript-viewer-extensions) **
